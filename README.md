# NotVi
NotVi is either a _bad_ Vi _"clone"_ or me trying out ncurses, you decide.

# Features
### COMMAND MODE
You know you are in **COMMAND MODE** when there is a `:` \
and nothing happens. Below there's a list of available options.
- `set` : Set a specific value
-- `number`/`nu` : Print line numbers. _**Note:** this is a toggle_ (Default = false)
-- `tabstop`/`tab` : Choose the length in spaces that a **TAB** will insert. (Default = 4)
#### [i]NSERT MODE
Allows you to write, move around and delete stuff.
